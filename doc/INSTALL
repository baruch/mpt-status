How can I compile mpt-status
----------------------------
Simply go with

	make

and if your kernel sources are not located at /usr/src/linux, try

	make KERNEL_PATH=/path/to/your/kernel/src

If this does not work, send me (Roberto Nibali) an email with the output and I
try to fix it. You might also need to tweak the Makefile shipped with this
package.

IMPORTANT: Try to compile mpt-status on a machine with the same kernel headers
           on which kernel version the resulting mpt-status binary will run on.
           If you compile mpt-status with 2.6.x headers and deploy the binary
           on a 2.4.x kernel based system, it might be that the tool will try
           to fetch the wrong pages and this can result in major havoc!


How can I install mpt-status
----------------------------
Simply go with (as user root)

	make install

This will install the mpt-status binary into /usr/sbin. If you need another
path, you can prefix the installation path by setting PREFIX like follows:

	make PREFIX=/my/prefix/path

To check if the mpt-status binary is installed into the correct path, invoke

	make -n install

and carefully check the output. If you're a distro packager or you otherwise
need to create a package relative to the final path, you have the possibility
to specify the DESTDIR variable. Following install call:

	make DESTDIR=/var/tmp/package install

would install the mpt-status binary into

	/var/tmp/package/usr/sbin/mpt-status

You can now also install the man page by invoking

	make install_doc

This will install the mpt-status.8 man page.


How can I uninstall mpt-status
------------------------------
Simply go with (as user root)

	make uninstall

If you previously installed mpt-status into a prefixed directory you also have
to provide this prefix to the uninstall target, like so:

	make PREFIX=/my/prefix/path uninstall

Since this is only one simple binary, the uninstall target is almost ridiculous
so for real hardcore hackers, you might also use ... rm:

	\rm -f /path/to/mpt-status

or if you so wish:

	make -n uninstall | sh

You can now also uninstall the man page by invoking

	make uninstall_doc

This will uninstall the mpt-status.8 man page.


If you don't have the kernel sources package installed (Redhat based info)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This applies to FC3/FC4 and RH ES4 (*).

1. Do "up2date --get-source kernel"
2. Kernel src rpm is now in /var/spool/up2date. Install it with
   "rpm -Uvh /var/spool/up2date/kernel-<version>.src.rpm"
3. Do  "cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/"
4. Do "rpmbuild -bp --target=i686 kernel-2.6.spec"
5. Last, you can move the source in the /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-<version>
   directory to the /usr/src tree; while not strictly necessary, we suggest that
   you do this to match the generally-available documentation.
6. cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-<version> /usr/src/
7. mv linux-<version> /usr/src/
8. cd /usr/src
9. ln -s ./linux-<version> linux
