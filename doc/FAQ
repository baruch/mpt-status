mpt-status frequently asked questions (FAQ)
===========================================

Eventually this should turn into a FAQ document, but right now there are not
too many questions, so I just put some emails into it.

---------------------------------------------
> Let's take examples from the README.
> <!--- Example #1 -->
> ioc0 vol 0 type IM, 2 phy, 68 GB, flags ENABLED, state OPTIMAL
> ioc0 phy 0 IBM-ESXS MAS3735NC     FN C901, 68 GB, state ONLINE
> ioc0 phy 1 IBM-ESXS ST373453LC    FN B85D, 68 GB, state ONLINE

This is the output of the old program, I've removed this output from the README in the upcoming 1.1.5 version.

> <!--- Example #2 -->
> SR2400:~# ./mpt-status -i 0
> ioc0 vol_id 0 type IS, 0 phy, 0 GB, state OPTIMAL, flags NONE

This means that you do not have your disks in slot 0 of your SCSI controller.

> <!--- Example #3 -->
> SR2400:~# ./mpt-status -i 1
> ioc0 vol_id 1 type IM, 2 phy, 68 GB, state OPTIMAL, flags ENABLED
> ioc0 phy 0 scsi_id 1 SEAGATE  ST373207LC       0003, 68 GB, state ONLINE, flags NONE
> ioc0 phy 1 scsi_id 3 SEAGATE  ST373207LC       0003, 68 GB, state ONLINE, flags NONE

Excellent. The next version of mpt-status should guide you and detect the slot id (you have id 1) automatically.

> Here are my questions.
> 1) Could you tell me from example #1, #2 and #3 where can you see the Raid Level of each hard disk?

The raid level is not visible, would you like to get this information as well? Or do you want to extract the health state of each disk?

> 2) Could you give the meaning of these abbreviations?

Maybe:

> FN=?

This is the vendor's product revision level of the hard disk. Taking your examples #1 and #3, we gather following information:

#1: ioc0 phy 0 IBM-ESXS MAS3735NC     FN C901, 68 GB, state ONLINE
#3: ioc0 phy 0 scsi_id 1 SEAGATE  ST373207LC       0003, 68 GB, state ONLINE, flags NONE

IBM-ESXS: the vendor id
SEAGATE: the vendor id

MAS3735NC: the product id
ST373207LC: the product id

FN C901: the product revision level
0003: the product revision level

So, as you can see, FN is part of the product revision level of this IBM hard disk.

> IS=?

Integrated Striping (RAID 0)

> IM=?

Integrated Mirroring (RAID 1)

and there is also IME, which means Integrated Mirroring + Enhanced (RAID 1E).
