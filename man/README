This is the man page written by Steffen Joeris for the Debian project.
I have shamelessly taken this from his patchset against mpt-status,
which can be found here:

    http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/mpt-status

The reasons I've done this, is that according to the man page I'm allowed
to do so and there's absolutely no point in some other distribution not
having a man page. It's all about the marginal unity of the distributions.

I'd like to thank Steffen Joeris for his work (because the last time I've
written a man page was probably in 1996).
